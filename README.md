# Traffic_Violation_Detector

This project uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) with Python to detect and track traffic violations such as signal jumping, overspeeding, and lane violations. The model processes video footage or real-time camera streams to automatically identify rule-breaking vehicles and log them for further action.

✨ Features

* Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8.
* Works with both images and video stream.
